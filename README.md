# brucelee

## background
I just watched a video in youtube, in which a guy said Bruce Lee is 4 times faster punches than the quickest guy does in the world. Then the idea comes out.

## game
A facebook online game in which players can click on space as quickly as possible. If someone in the game can do it 4 times faster than the second faster guy, the winer is Bruce Lee.

## Game Engine
Phaser is an engine to create 2D games, I found out their github is quite active and documents are pretty easy as well.
